Summary of Visualization Implementation
I've created a comprehensive visualization system for the Soul Development Framework with the following components:

Field Visualization Module

Visualizes void field properties, Sephiroth fields, and field interactions
Provides comprehensive field dashboard for monitoring the system


Soul Journey Visualization Module

Visualizes journey timeline, Sephiroth path, and creator entanglement
Provides detailed visualizations for each stage of soul development


Visualization Integration Module

Acts as a central manager for all visualization components
Handles configuration, file management, and stage filtering


Controller Visualization Hooks

Adds non-invasive hooks to existing controllers at key decision points
Enables automatic visualization generation during processing


Standalone Visualization Tool

Provides command-line tool for generating visualizations of completed souls
Supports batch processing of multiple souls



The system is designed to visualize the soul at these critical decision points:

After Guff strengthening (to verify initial energy and stability)
After Sephiroth journey (to check resonance with the correct Sephirah)
After creator entanglement (to verify connection quality)
After harmonic strengthening (to check frequency and energy patterns)
After life cord formation (to check cord integrity)
Before birth (to verify all metrics look good for successful incarnation)
After birth (to confirm successful incarnation)

This approach keeps the visualization logic separate from the core process logic 
while still allowing comprehensive visual output at key points. The hooks are designed 
to be non-invasive, so they won't affect the core functionality if visualization is disable
