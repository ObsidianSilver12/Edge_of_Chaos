understand the refactor versus the simplified structure here
where are the gaps?
what functionality did refactor include that this doesn't
does the refactor follow principles?
where does refactor diverge from principles?
where can refactor be improved based on the understanding that this is a neuroplastic brain. we need a properly formed neural network and mycelial network but we do not require massive complexity. 
pros and cons of stopping code after brain formation of neural network and brain structure with fields etc but no functionality? why because this is a system function and maybe its even a stage 2 thing before system.

intention - once formed we will run certain baby brain learning focused on sight and sound we will have ways for model to signal understanding but also to interact with me on associations its making initially. this should allow for a teaching approach between mother and child ie if i showed a square, and i showed a circle, then i showed a different square could the model determine its a square. this is very different than how normal neural networks are trained. so training fundamentals before doing datasets etc. intend to train multi modal from start - text, sound and visual. we will add other senses later in a way that is machine understandable/appropriate. 

files i created - 
conception follows seed creation, placement, womb creation, mycelial storage area
development is neural network creation, mycelial network creation, placing mycelial seeds, activating te energy system from the mycelial network seed
memory - create the mapping, assign coordinates in 3d brain grid, retrieval/search, pattern recognition and pruning
processing - not sure what classes or functions to process thought, synaptic processes, memory, learning etc. this is the the calculations needed for monitoring feedback loops and adjusting accordingly.
state - monitoring and event triggers as a feedback loop between processing, monitoring and energy.

I did not write out descriptions for every function mostly self explanatory but if not uou can ask follow up questions
