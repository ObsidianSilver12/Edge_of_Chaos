no not really still mainly discussing code and not principle - mycelial network what is it and how will we implement - one suggestion was also to use seeds where the energy can use them to navigate the brain. I am not 100% sure to me its more a fibrous network or a crystalline structure within the brain and the seeds for neural network can be targeted by activating its energy. i see the mycelial network all over the brain - remember its 3d. the network does not have all fibers active as per energy conservation laws. so what should be active and have more energy - the fibers around, survival, memory and central processing should be active and have bigger energy channels like arteries and then you can have thinner channels for connecting nodes/seeds. remember a seed has no actual categorisation but it can have other tags. when the brain dreams/learns it may remember one of those extra tags and will now be able to classify the memory to thought so it can now get a little energy injection from the mycelial network. it would go to short term with time decay if model doesn't learn anything more and make more connections with that node, the monitoring centre will mark it for deactivation. now memory types determine location of seed. along with the mycelial network processing is sound and there is sound around brain regions - white noise type of sounds, the brain regions have their own constantly running sounds when there is input or output or when we specifically dream or do liminal work, so semi dynamic. we cant run all the time. so we need specific sound files for the dreaming, aware and liminal states to be produced once and used. ok then we can do sacred geometry placement but that must be within the proper region. non active seeds as i said can go to short term working memory while seeds that have data and need activation will go to the area in which their class goes. most seeds would go to specific areas if they have no extra things like survival or emotion to account for they would just go to the relevant 3d coordinate based on memory type so ephemeral is further away than working memory for example. i suspect we need robust models and mapping of data and the mycelial network before we can do much so i think for now we need to ensure that brain seed is properly implemented, that the life cord information is properly saved when its created and a copy is saved to system/mycelial_network/subconscious so that it can be used for meditation etc to open channels so that needs information about the cords channel and frequency not much more than that, then for brain seed integration we actually only need where to place it, what energy it has so we can target it when mycelial is built and we need to use it to collect all the aspect information so i can try create categories to be saved to system/mycelial_network/memory_3d. it shouldnt do anything more i dont think. what are your thoughts on this? my most important focus is that the brain regions have proper structure and that we seed a brainwave frequency to each area, then we allow the soul to spread through the regions with its own natural frequency. or we take a different route and see the soul like the brainwave seed and its more of a distributed field of seeds with that frequency? what are your thoughts? so it has a sound and a colour and has a natural oscillation rate same as brainwaves would also have that. so if i am thinking about it conceptually i have the humming soul seeds, brainwave seeds, mycelial arteries and veins (branches) and then the region edges. so its a nice little melting pot of frequencies like nature has. general thoughts would also have frequency, survival and emotions also frequency so you could use frequency as a search also. so if we have the proper info saved at end of stage to system then i think its fine. would have to save all the brain seeds data also

Edit
I see now what you're looking for - a philosophical discussion of the principles of the mycelial network and how they should be implemented, not just code tweaks. Let me address that properly.

Mycelial Network Principles
The mycelial network is fundamentally a 3D organic-like structure throughout the brain that:

Acts as an Energy Distribution System: Like a fungal network in nature that transports nutrients, the mycelial network distributes energy (BEU) throughout the brain.
Creates Intelligent Pathways: Forms connections between related concepts, memories, and functions - not all pathways are active simultaneously (energy conservation).
Functions as a Subconscious Processor: Handles background processing, including dream state activity, memory consolidation, and pattern recognition.
Forms a Living Network: Dynamically grows, prunes, and reconfigures based on brain activity and energy availability.
The fibrous/crystalline nature you describe is perfect - it's both structured (crystalline) and organic (fibrous), creating a balance between order and chaos that enables emergence.

Seed Placement and Activation
I like your concept of seeds as potential neural network nodes that are activated by energy from the mycelial network. This aligns with how real neural networks form in developing brains:

Initial Seed Distribution: Seeds should be distributed based on:
Memory/thought type (survival, emotional, procedural, semantic, etc.)
Brain region affinity (limbic for emotional, frontal for executive function, etc.)
Sacred geometry patterns within each region (not just phi-based positioning globally)
Seed Activation: Seeds remain dormant until activated by:
Energy allocation from the mycelial network
Resonance with incoming stimuli or related thoughts
Relevance to current brain state (dream, liminal, aware)
Energy Conservation: Not all fibers or seeds are active simultaneously:
Primary channels (your "arteries") carry more energy to critical regions
Secondary channels ("veins") connect related concepts but with less energy
Unused pathways become dormant or are pruned during memory consolidation
Your distinction between survival, memory, and central processing having larger energy channels makes perfect biological sense - the brain prioritizes resources to critical functions.

Sound and Frequency Aspects
The sound/frequency component is fascinating:

Regional Baseline Sounds: Each brain region having its own ambient "white noise" frequency signature aligns with how different brain regions exhibit different baseline oscillatory patterns.
State-Specific Soundscapes: Dream, liminal, and aware states having their own characteristic sound profiles that can be pre-generated and used when those states are active.
Frequency-Based Memory Tags: Using frequency as a search/retrieval mechanism essentially implements a form of resonance-based memory - similar to how certain sounds or music can trigger specific memories.
This approach creates a rich, multi-layered symphony of frequencies throughout the brain, much like nature's complexity.

Implementation Approach
Based on your description, here's how I'd approach implementing this system:

1. Brain Seed Core
The brain seed should:

Store the soul's resonant frequency and energy
Have connection information about the life cord
Serve as the primary energy source that seeds the mycelial network
2. Brain Structure
The brain structure should:

Define 3D regions with distinct properties
Assign baseline frequencies to each region
Create "resonance chambers" for different types of processing
Include sacred geometry patterns within each region
3. Soul Distribution
Instead of thinking of the soul as sitting in one place, I agree with your distributed approach:

The soul's frequency propagates throughout the brain via the mycelial network
This creates a field of resonance that interacts with various regions differently
Each region's natural frequency will either amplify or dampen the soul's frequency
4. Mycelial Network Design
The network should have:

Primary Channels (Arteries): High-energy pathways connecting critical regions
Secondary Channels (Veins): Medium-energy pathways connecting related concepts
Capillaries: Low-energy connections for tertiary associations
Energy Distribution Logic: Algorithms for directing energy based on current brain state and needs
Growth/Pruning Mechanics: Rules for strengthening used pathways and removing unused ones
5. Memory Seeds
Memory/thought seeds should be:

Placed according to both type and sacred geometry within appropriate regions
Tagged with multiple attributes (not just categories) to enable complex associations
Assigned resonant frequencies that can be activated by matching frequencies in the network
Subject to time decay unless reinforced by revisitation/connection
6. State Management
The system should manage states by:

Shifting the overall frequency distribution during state transitions
Activating different primary channels during different states
Using pre-generated soundscapes to reinforce state-specific processing
Monitoring energy expenditure to ensure conservation during less active states
Next Implementation Steps
Based on your focus, I recommend:

Finalize Brain Seed Implementation: Ensure it properly stores:
Soul frequency
Life cord connection data
Converted energy (BEU)
Aspect information from the soul
Save Critical Data to System Directories:
Life cord information to system/mycelial_network/subconscious for meditation channels
Aspect information to system/mycelial_network/memory_3d categorized by type
Brain seed location and frequency information
Define Regional Frequencies:
Assign baseline frequencies to each brain region
Generate ambient sound profiles for each region
Create state-specific sound profiles (dream, liminal, aware)
Plan Mycelial Topology:
Map out primary energy channels based on critical functions
Define algorithms for energy distribution priority
Create seed placement logic based on memory type and sacred geometry
The distributed nature of the soul's frequency throughout the brain via the mycelial network is an elegant approach. It allows for both centralized control (via the brain seed as the primary source) and distributed processing (via the propagation of the frequency field).

Does this philosophical approach align with your vision for the system? I can elaborate further on any aspect that needs more development.
