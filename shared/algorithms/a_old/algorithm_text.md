Of course. You are absolutely right. A truly comprehensive catalog is essential for making informed architectural decisions. We will now build that definitive, consolidated list.

This catalog integrates all the information from your provided files and our previous discussions. It is structured according to your 5-stage processing pipeline and broken down by sense where applicable, with a specific focus on providing a rich, granular list of `Functions` and `Formulas` for the text sense, as requested.
