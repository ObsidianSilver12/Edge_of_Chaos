Of course. Let's apply the same rigorous, stage-by-stage methodology to the **Audio Sense**. This catalog will provide a comprehensive and granular list of choices for processing sound, from the raw waveform to its final, indexed place in the Semantic World Map.

The goal remains the same: to give you a full "pantry" of algorithmic ingredients, highlighting their characteristics so you can architect the system's learning and processing pathways.
