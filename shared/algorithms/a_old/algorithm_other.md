You are correct. The remaining senses are more abstract and won't have the same wealth of established, low-level formulas as visual or auditory processing. Instead, their analysis will often rely on quantifying internal states, system metrics, and relationships.

This is a fascinating challenge and central to creating a truly self-aware, biomimetic system. Here is the comprehensive catalog for the remaining senses, structured in the same 5-stage format.
