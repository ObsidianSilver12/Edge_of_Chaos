HOW TO RUN THE TREE OF LIFE 3D MODELING TOOL
=============================================

PREREQUISITES:
-------------
1. Node.js (version 14 or higher) must be installed on your computer
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/

INSTALLATION:
------------
1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. Navigate to this directory:
   cd C:\Kim\Claude\Edge_of_Chaos\tree-of-life-3d-model

3. Install the required dependencies:
   npm install

   This will take a few minutes as it downloads all necessary packages.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
----------------------
1. In the same directory, start the development server:
   npm start

2. The application should automatically open in your default web browser
   - If it doesn't, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

USING THE APPLICATION:
--------------------
1. The 10 Sephiroth nodes are already placed in the traditional Tree of Life arrangement
2. Use the buttons in the left panel to add Platonic solids to the scene
3. Click and drag objects to move them in 3D space
4. Use the orbit controls (dragging the background) to rotate the view
5. Connect points and take measurements to identify geometric patterns

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure Node.js is properly installed
   - Check by running: node --version

2. If dependencies fail to install, try clearing npm cache:
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install

3. If the app crashes or doesn't start:
   - Check for error messages in the terminal
   - Try closing and reopening the terminal
   - Restart your computer if necessary

4. For performance issues:
   - Close other applications
   - Use a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
