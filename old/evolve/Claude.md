#Refactored files
this refactor did not go as intended the mycelial network is at times to complex for a baby brain that has neuroplasticity
the concept of seed formation was overly aligned to creator like the soul spark the seed is just a recepticle for energy from creator to power the initial brain formation. It has no other function the seed is the idea of conception fusion that cascades an effect to start cell division but in this case its providing power for the brain grid, regions and sub regions to form with the static sound providing barriers within each sub region that act as a dampener to contain brain wave frequency to a degree. it is still permeable to allow for larger frequency/field changes to occur if conditions exist that would naturally need this.
brain structure got to complex with extra grids. the grid is supposed to be a 3d grid with regions, sub regions and sub region boundaries that are static sound. it is supposed to have similarity to brain structure but did not need to be 100% anatomically correct. the brain grid uses sparse representation for the neural network, memory system (subconscious/mycelial network). the brain is not supposed to be exactly the same for each simulation. there should be a mechanism to allow the brain to grow between 2-8% in some regions. Ideas on why a brain would be different need to be detailed and reported back as options to consider
mycelial network - was too complex yet it did not cover alot? compare this refactor to the basic outline in memory.py, processing.py and state.py under stage_1/brain_formation
alot of ideas in refactor.md and integratedDesign.md

but as I said refactor did not integrate the core principles and placed to much emphasis on certain things. Principles is what matters 
Standing waves
Static Field is constant
Electromagnetism - if can be used and effect
conservation of energy
quantum entanglement
quantum principles - quantum superposition if needed, wave collapse, quantum communication
physics where appropriate
proper maths not representative or factor based fake maths to achieve an outcome
edge of chaos used in dream states and for other conditions where recursion is needed
mother resonance to calm model in womb - its not a pervasive thing its a trigger based thing ie model stressed calm with mother
creator energy is used to start conception through brain seed and to drive brain formation and initial energy for storage in mycelial network. energy system of mycelial network to have a minimum of 2 weeks of brain energy - # Derived Energy Calculations
SYNAPSES_COUNT_FOR_MIN_ENERGY: int = int(1e9)  # 1 billion synapses for baseline calc
SECONDS_IN_14_DAYS: float = 14 * 24 * 60 * 60
ENERGY_BRAIN_14_DAYS_JOULES: float = SYNAPSE_ENERGY_JOULES * SYNAPSES_COUNT_FOR_MIN_ENERGY * SECONDS_IN_14_DAYS the brain energy units used are a scaled
down factor this calculation does to reduce compute due to very large numbers.
mycelial network stores and classifies memories, triggers node creation and inactivation, controls dream,liminal and awareness states based on needs (feedback system), it feeds,returns and retains and sometimes grows energy, it is the sub conscious responsible for many autonomic functions. discuss what the primary baby brain functions must be. compare refactor to new files for memory, processing and state
