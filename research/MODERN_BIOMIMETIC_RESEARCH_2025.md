```python
# Contrastive objective
def contrastive_loss(image_features, audio_features, temperature=0.07):
    similarities = cosine_similarity(image_features, audio_features)
    logits = similarities / temperature

    attention_weights = attention_mechanism(node_features, edge_indices)
    messages = aggregate_messages(attention_weights, node_features)
    return update_function(node_features, messages)
```

## Quality Assurance Through Backward/Forward Processing

### 1. Predictive Validation Framework

**Architecture:**
```python
def validation_pipeline(input_data, prediction_model, verification_model):
    # Forward prediction
    prediction = prediction_model(input_data)
    
    # Backward verification
    reconstructed = verification_model(prediction)
    consistency_score = similarity(input_data, reconstructed)
    
    # Multi-model validation
    expert_verification = expert_model.validate(prediction)
    
    return prediction if consistency_score > threshold else reject
```

**Quality Checks:**
- **Reconstruction loss**: Can the prediction reconstruct the input?
- **Expert validation**: Does a specialized model agree?
- **Consistency checks**: Are predictions stable across time?
- **Pattern verification**: Do extracted patterns match known biological templates?

### 2. Multi-Model Consensus Architecture

**Consensus Mechanism:**
```python
def multi_model_consensus(input_data, model_ensemble):
    predictions = [model(input_data) for model in model_ensemble]
    
    # Calculate prediction agreement
    consensus_score = calculate_agreement(predictions)
    
    if consensus_score > confidence_threshold:
        return weighted_average(predictions)
    else:
        return request_human_supervision(input_data, predictions)
```

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Ensemble agreement**: Multiple models must agree
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Measure prediction confidence
- **Active learning**: Request supervision for uncertain cases
- **Gradual improvement**: Models learn from consensus decisions

### 3. Biological Plausibility Constraints

**Constraint Validation:**
```python
def biological_constraint_check(neural_activity, brain_state):
    # Energy consumption check
    energy_usage = calculate_energy(neural_activity)
    if energy_usage > biological_limits:
        return reject_pattern
    
    # Frequency analysis
    frequencies = fft_analysis(neural_activity)
    if not within_biological_range(frequencies):
        return reject_pattern
    
    # Temporal coherence
    coherence = calculate_coherence(neural_activity, brain_state)
    return coherence > minimum_coherence
```
